# Project Description

Using real data from Music service, we will test hypotheses and compare the behavior of users in two big cities.

### Hypotheses
1. User activity depends on the day of the week. Moreover, in Moscow and St. Petersburg this manifests itself in different ways.
2. On Monday morning, certain genres of music prevail in Moscow, while others prevail in St. Petersburg. This is true for Friday evening as well.
3. Moscow and St. Petersburg prefer different genres of music. In Moscow, they listen to pop music more often, in St. Petersburg - Russian rap.

### Data
The data is stored in `music_project.csv` file.

### Description of columns:

- `artist` — artist name;
