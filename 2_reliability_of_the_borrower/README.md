# Project description

The customer is the credit department of the bank. It is necessary to find out whether the marital status and the number of children of the client impact the fact of repaying the loan on time. Initial data from the bank - statistics on the economic condition of customers. The results of the study will be taken into consideration when building a credit-scoring model - a special system that assesses the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to a bank.

### Data Description

- `children` — number of children in the family
- `days_employed` - total work experience in days
- `dob_years` - client's age in years
- `education` — the level of education of the client
- `education_id` — education level identifier
- `family_status` - marital status
- `family_status_id` - marital status identifier
- `gender` - gender of the client
- `income_type` - type of employment
- `debt` - whether he had debt to repay loans
- `total_income` - monthly income
- `purpose` - the purpose of obtaining a loan

After our analysis we are going to answer the following questions:

- Is there a relationship between the number of children and loan repayment on time?
- Is there a relationship between marital status and loan repayment on time?
- Is there a relationship between income and loan repayment on time?
- How do different purposes of a loan affect its repayment on time?
